# Sony TA-AX 44
Retrieve the magic bits from the ancient NEC 4-bit MCUs

# Emulator

A work-in-progress emulator of the whole system can be found here: https://github.com/lmiori92/astrowars

What works:

 - ASP (Audio Signal Processor) basic simulation i.e. reading processor command data
 - NVRAM (Non Volatile Random Access Memory) simulation (i.e. read / write data from processor command)
 - Basic VFD (missing elements)
